# Legacy Contract

A Privacy-Preserving Smart Contract for Asset Inheritance

## Overview
This repository contains a Solidity smart contract that enables secure and private inheritance of digital assets using zero-knowledge proofs (Halo2). The contract allows users to create private vaults, manage assets, and set up emergency access while maintaining privacy.
