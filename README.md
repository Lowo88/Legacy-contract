## 🚨 Security Notice

This project is currently in development and **HAS NOT BEEN AUDITED**. Do not use in production or with real assets until:
- Full security audit is completed
- Test coverage reaches >95%
- Bug bounty program is established
- Community review period is completed

## 📖 Overview

A Solidity-based smart contract enabling secure and private inheritance of digital assets using zero-knowledge proofs (Halo2). This project aims to solve the critical problem of digital asset succession while maintaining privacy and security.

### Key Features

- 🔐 Private vault management with time-locked assets
- 👥 Multi-signature emergency access system
- 🛡️ Zero-knowledge proof integration using Halo2
- 📋 Customizable inheritance templates
- ⏰ Time-based access controls
- 🔄 Asset health monitoring
- 📱 Mobile-friendly interface (coming soon)
- 🔄 ZK-rollup integration for scalability
- 🕵️ ZCash privacy features integration
- 📦 Batch transaction processing
